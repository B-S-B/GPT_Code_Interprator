This is a Demo project to demostrate on the below Problem statement:
- You’ve to develop a Chat Code-Interpreter application using OpenAI APIs (gpt-3.5-turbo mainly). 
    - For UI you’ve to use Chainlit. 
    - Please don’t use LangChain or LlamaIndex or any such framework. 
    - Try to solve this using first principles and use the openai library in Python. 
    - The output should’ve the following things. Please don’t use the Assistants API as well.
- The input will be .csv files and some user message similar to what we’ve in ChatGPT code interpreter (advanced data analytics)
Based on the message the assistant should write code and execute it.
- The user can even do general chit-chat so please be ready for that as well.
- Write reusable code and modules.
- The UI should be done using Chainlit strictly.
- To show the output create a GitHub repo with a Readme.md file
- Please add Dockerfile in the Github repo and take OPENAI_API_KEY as an environment variable so that we can run your code and check the output.

## To Experiance the App start with the new Chat. Thankyou !
## Limitations
- This app is designed for single chat at a time.
- You have an options to attach a file but is limited to only CSV files.
- It will not explicitly ask you to upload any csv file but it can detect attachment and consume it.
- The app is not designed to generate image or any other media as its GPT3.5 Turbo under the hood.
- You can also perform casual chat if you wish to.
- By default the personlaity of the chat agent is set for a Data Scientist if you wish to change that provide prompts accordingly.
